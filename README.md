# SpeedReader

PHP Assignment 2 which is a web application similar to Spritz. A series of words are presented quickly in succession.
By design, the reader is only able to focus on a single word at a time. 
And furthermore, the words appear at such a speed that the reader is unable to subvocalize like normal.
The goal of a speed reader is to develop good reading skills.

## Features
* A user can create an account and log in
* A user can resume reading a book from where they left off, at the speed (words per minute) at which they were 
* New users start at the beginning of the book, at a slow pace (50 words per minute).
* At any point, the user can change the speed setting

This web application is written in PHP (backend) and JavaScript (frontend).
